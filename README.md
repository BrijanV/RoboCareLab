# Proactive Task Execution with Robotic Arms and Assistive Robots

This repository contains **research documentation** summarizing completed projects conducted under the **RoboCare Lab** at **Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI)**.  
The work focuses on developing **human-centric, intention-aware robotic systems** for assistive manipulation and interaction.

---

## Overview

The projects documented in this repository explore how robots can proactively assist humans by combining perception, motion planning, and high-level intent understanding. The emphasis is on **autonomous task execution in human environments**, with applications in assistive robotics, healthcare, and collaborative manipulation.

The repository serves as an **academic record of system design, methodology, and research progress**, rather than a software release.

## Project Summaries

### Project 1: Proactive Task Execution with Robotic Arms

This project investigates an intention-aware robotic manipulation pipeline using a **UR3e robotic arm** in an eye-to-hand configuration.

**Key goals include:**
- Autonomous pick-and-place based on visual perception
- Accurate object localization using RGB-D sensing
- Motion planning for safe and reliable manipulation
- Laying the foundation for human-intent inference

The long-term objective is to enable the robot to interpret **human verbal and visual cues** (e.g., gestures or spoken requests) and proactively execute assistive tasks such as delivering objects.
